<h3><a class="name" id="1" href="#1">Which Operating Systems are currently supported by BitTorrent Speed?</a></h3>
<p>
As for now, BitTorrent Speed is only integrated with μTorrent client for Windows™. BitTorrent Speed is compatible with Windows™ versions 7, 8, 8.1, and 10. 
</p>

<hr>
<h3><a class="name" id="2" href="#2">What should I do to get BitTorrent Speed added to my μTorrent client?</a></h3>
<p>
Once you have μTorrent client for Windows installed, everything should happen automatically. It might take some time for the application to be downloaded, verified, and installed, so please be patient. After BitTorrent Speed is installed, you will see the item in the navigation menu.
</p>

<hr>
<h3><a class="name" id="3" href="#3">My antivirus software is detecting the μtorrent install as malware. What should I do?</a></h3>
<p>
	
Antivirus companies are going beyond detecting viruses and malware and into categories of “potentially unwanted programs” they feel you may not want even though they aren’t dangerous.<br>
Note that it is not our clients themselves that are flagged under either category, but occasionally our partner install offers that are flagged in this “potentially unwanted program” category.<br>
 
Please note that absolutely nothing is installed on your system without your consent during the installation. We suggest<ol>
<li> rejecting any partner offers you don’t want installed on uTorrent</li>
<li> adding an exception or temporarily disabling the antivirus software until you have completed your installation</li></ol>

</p>

<hr>
<h3><a class="name" id="4" href="#4">What changes in my regular μTorrent experience with Speed?</a></h3>
<p>
The overall torrenting experience will not be changed. The only difference will be an increase in download speed if you decide to use BitTorrent Speed!
</p>

<hr>
<h3><a class="name" id="5" href="#5">How can I control whether or not my client uses BitTorrent Speed?</a></h3>
<p>
	BitTorrent Speed is enabled by default for all μTorrent users.<br> There is an option to turn it off: go to Options ⟩ Preferences ⟩ Bittorrent ⟩ Uncheck Enable Protocol enhancements ⟩ Apply
</p>

<hr>
<h3><a class="name" id="6" href="#6">Is mining involved with BitTorrent Speed?</a></h3>
<p>
	No. BitTorrent Speed is based on pure exchange of BTT tokens between users without any intermediators.<br> There are only ways for users to get BTT tokens:<ul><li>Earn for seeding</li><li>Buy on any decentralized exchange service and transfer to BitTorrent Wallet.</li></ul>Find more information in the Wallet section.
</p>

<hr>
<h3><a class="name" id="7" href="#7">Can I control whether or not my client spends BTT?</a></h3>
<p>
	Yes, you can set up where you can earn but not spend. To do that, simply turn “Speed Increase” toggle into the “Off” state. Your ability to download won’t be impacted, but there will be no increase in speed.
</p>

<hr>
<h3><a class="name" id="8" href="#8">Can I completely run out of BTT?</a></h3>
<p>
	Yes, your balance may run out if you’ve spent all your BTT for faster downloads. You may replenish your balance by seeding and earning or by transferring BTT into BitTorrent Wallet. 
</p>

<hr>
<h3><a class="name" id="9" href="#9">How much does each person earn for seeding?</a></h3>
<p>
	Earnings depend on a variety of factors such as the demand for the file and network connection. 
</p>

<hr>
<h3><a class="name" id="10" href="#10">Why is the speed on the μTorrent client different from the speed displayed on BitTorrent Speed?</a></h3>
<p>
	The speed on μTorrent client reflects a count of download speeds for all the files, while BitTorrent Speed only shows stats for the downloads where token exchange is involved. 
</p>

<hr>
<h3><a class="name" id="11" href="#11">Is there a daily limit for the number of uploads or downloads in a day?</a></h3>
<p>
	There is no such limit. The more actively you seed, the more chances of earning BTT you get. 
</p>

<hr>
<h3><a class="name" id="12" href="#12">What can I do if I lost my Wallet password?</a></h3>
<p>
	First of all, we are sorry to hear that. So far, there is no password restoration mechanism in a place, so we strongly recommend that users remember or write down passwords and keep them in a safe space.
The only way to get access to BitTorrent Speed again is to install it from scratch. This is going to be a new wallet, so all the assets will be reset to their initial state. If you want to take this path, please uninstall uTorrent, then get to %AppData% → Roaming → uTorrent and delete all files that are left. Then, do the same with the helper folder. 
</p>

<hr>
<h3><a class="name" id="13" href="#13">BitTorrent Speed has a red cross icon next to it and doesn’t launch on click. What can I do?</a></h3>
<p>
	There are multiple reasons why this may happen: Windows configuration, permissions, interrupted installation process, etc. The easiest solution is to re-install uTorrent client with BitTorrent Speed. <br><ol><li>Complete all downloads</li><li>Uninstall uTorrent</li><li>Open File Explorer and type in %AppData%\Roaming\</li><li>Delete uTorrent folder</li><li>Go to %AppData%\Local\ and delete BitTorrent Helper folder</li><li>Install uTorrent Client from scratch</li></ol><br>Feel free to use the contact form on the website if your problem was not solved by the information above.
</p>

<hr>
<h3><a class="name" id="14" href="#14">What happens when I switch the Speed Increase toggle off?</a></h3>
<p>
	When the toggle is off, your wallet becomes expelled from participation in auctions for the most high-demand pieces of content, and your download or waiting time will be longer than with the Speed Increase feature. Switching off Speed Increase doesn’t affect your ability to earn BTT for seeding. 
</p>

<hr>
<h3><a class="name" id="15" href="#15">Why am I seeing in-application balance decreasing after I switched the toggle off?</a></h3>
<p>
	You might see the balance changing within 24 hours after switching the Speed Increase toggle off. This happens because, when you bid on a piece of data, your BTT go to escrow first and stay there until you complete downloading the piece or until 24 hours passed – whichever comes first. If the piece was successfully downloaded, your bid goes to the seeder. If download was not complete, BTT from escrow will be transferred back to your balance.

<h3><a class="name" id="16" href="#16">What can I do to prevent other people from hacking into my account?</a></h3>
<p>
	Please note that, while we employ the highest level of security measures to protect your wallet assets, holding hot (online) cryptoassets is not without risk.<br>
			You are strongly advised to protect your device with adequate security measures at all times. Such measures include an access password, PIN, and biometric verification when logging in (among others).<br>Here are a few simple tips for your wallet protection:<ul><li>Be careful about where you go online when you’re using a device that has a wallet on it. Dangerous websites and risky Wi-Fi networks put your wallet at risk. At the same time, do not leave your device unattended or lend it to anyone.</li><li>Phishing scams through ads and through email are rampant in the crypto world. Phishing scams are becoming more and more elaborate, so make sure email received from wallet companies have their domain spelled correctly and never look for their web address clicking on ads. Once you send a phishing website your private key, you can say goodbye to your funds.</li><li>It’s important to double check the address to which you send any payment transaction. There are malicious programs that can edit a “copy and paste” procedure in order to paste a different address, and that new address belongs to an attacker. It’s usually best to send a micro payment as a verification and then send the larger payment to the verified address.</li></ul>

</p>

<hr>
<h3><a class="name" id="19" href="#19">How do I get a TRON wallet?</a></h3>
<p>
	Go to <a href="https://tron.network/wallet?lng=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TRON website</a> and install any TRX-supporting wallet from the catalog. Create an account (it‘s free!). After logging in, you will be able to transfer BTT from and to your TRON wallet. Don’t forget to secure it!

	<h1>Recovery Phrase Update</h1>
</p>



<hr>
<h3><a class="name" id="21" href="#21"> What is this update, and where do I get it? </a></h3>
<p>
	As part of the Version 1.1.0 release of BitTorrent Speed, we are including an update that is designed to create a more seamless user experience by making the recovery phrase fully compatible with the TRON blockchain protocol. Simply log on to BitTorrent Speed and follow the instructions before you restart your wallet. Once your wallet restarts, the update will be completed. 
</p>

<hr>
<h3><a class="name" id="22" href="#22"> Why am I getting a recovery phrase in this product update? </a></h3>
<p>
	The recovery phrase is a safer and easier method for restoring a cryptocurrency wallet compared to the private key. 
</p>

<hr>
<h3><a class="name" id="23" href="#23"> How will the update affect my digital assets? </a></h3>
<p>
	Your balances will not be affected. However, we suggest that you save both the old set of private and public keys and the recovery phrase to avoid losing access. 
</p>

<hr>
<h3><a class="name" id="24" href="#24"> Do I still have access to the old wallet that is connected to the old set of keys? Can I still restore the wallet and withdraw funds? </a></h3>
<p>
	Your access to the wallet with the old set of keys will still remain as long as you keep the old keys in a safe place to which only you have access. We are unable to retrieve your old keys once the update is finished. We suggest our users save their old keys as well as their new recovery phrase to avoid losing access to their assets on the blockchain. If you have any questions, please contact support at bttfeedback@bittorrent.com
